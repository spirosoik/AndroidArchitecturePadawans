  "body": "# Clean Android Architecture for Padawans\r\nThis repository shows how to separate layers of an application for newcomers in Android world with a simple application based on Foursquare API. \r\nAfter this you will become a Padawan and this means that you have made a great progress to become a JEDI.\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/soikonomakis/Padawan.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf you understood this simple architecture you will be able to go further in Android World and more complex and cleaner architecutes\r\nlike MVP, MVVP.\r\n\r\nThe architecture is simple. Check below:\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/soikonomakis/app_architecture.png)\r\n\r\nA quick description is that I separated the presentation layer and the data layer. \r\nThe data layer is a simple java library and not an android library although it can be an Android Library also. \r\neg. if you want to access a database and you need the context.\r\n\r\nThe data layer doesn't know anything about the presentation layer is completely agnostic about it. \r\nThe data layer can access a Database or a REST API and it will return back \r\nto presentation layer business objects (Entities in this case). \r\n\r\n**Important note:** You must not send back to the presentation layer the Data Object (DTO of retrofit) \r\nbecause you need to have a business object with business rules (Domain layer in Clean architecture), that's why\r\nwe need DataMappers which will convert the DTO to BO.\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n* Event-Driven programming with Otto\r\n* Dependency injection with Dagger2\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\n* [Retrofit 1.9.0](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)\r\n* [OkHttp 2.4.0](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)\r\n* [Otto Eventbus 1.3.8](http://square.github.io/otto/)\r\n* [Dagger 2.0](http://google.github.io/dagger/)\r\n* [ButterKnife 7.0.1](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife)\r\n* [Otto Picasso 2.5.2] (http://square.github.io/picasso/)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2015 Economakis Spyridon\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n",
